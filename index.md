# Milestones 1–2 — arXiv Data Pipeline

**HCMUS | Introduction to Data Science | NAME: THIỀU QUANG | ID: 24127114**

This landing page introduces the cumulative Jupyter Book reports for
Milestones 1 and 2. The detailed reports are listed in the sidebar.

## Project stages

1. **Milestone 1 — Crawling arXiv:** collect version-specific source files
   and publication-level reference metadata for the assigned papers.
2. **Milestone 2 — Hierarchical parsing and standardization:** parse and
   normalize LaTeX content, citations, and document structure.

## Milestone 1 — Crawling arXiv

**Assigned range:** `2607.13694` to `2607.18693` (5,000 base identifiers, inclusive).

### Project scope

1. Resolve each assigned arXiv ID and enumerate all available versions.
2. Download every version-specific original source archive from arXiv and retain only `.tex` and `.bib`. Keep LaTeX figure commands, not the figure binaries.
3. Retrieve publication-level reference metadata from Semantic Scholar, retaining all references in the working dataset and exporting the arXiv-identified subset for the two required tables.
4. Measure crawl coverage, archive bytes before vs retained LaTeX bytes, reference coverage, time, RAM, and disk use.

The *actual* statistics, figures and tables below are generated during notebook compilation from exported local crawler logs. If data has not been synced yet, charts are omitted instead of presenting fabricated metrics.

### Source and reliability policy

- Atom API `id_list` can provide exact-version metadata, but it may return HTTP 429. OAI-PMH `arXivRaw` is used for targeted discovery and version dates when appropriate; it **does not provide historical titles/authors/abstracts for every revision**.
- Source downloads are version-specific. PDF-only and source-free submissions are counted explicitly, and must not be confused with network errors.
- Semantic Scholar provides references at **publication level**, not necessarily per version. A reference publication date from Semantic Scholar is **not** substituted for its first arXiv submission date.
- Failed requests remain retryable; a partial result is not described as 100% success.

## Milestone 2 — Hierarchical Parsing and Standardization

This stage parses the crawled source files, standardizes their content,
and builds structured document hierarchies.
